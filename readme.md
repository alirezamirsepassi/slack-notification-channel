### Prerequisites

Before you can send notifications via Slack, you must install the Guzzle HTTP library via Composer:

    composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

You will also need to configure an ["Incoming Webhook"](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) integration for your Slack team. This integration will provide you with a URL you may use when [routing Slack notifications](#routing-slack-notifications).

### Formatting Slack Notifications

If a notification supports being sent as a Slack message, you should define a `toSlack` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return a `Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage` instance. Slack messages may contain text content as well as an "attachment" that formats additional text or an array of fields. Let's take a look at a basic `toSlack` example:

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->content('One of your invoices has been paid!');
    }

In this example we are just sending a single line of text to Slack, which will create a message that looks like the following:

#### Customizing The Sender & Recipient

You may use the `from` and `to` methods to customize the sender and recipient. The `from` method accepts a username and emoji identifier, while the `to` method accepts a channel or username:

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->from('Ghost', ':ghost:')
                    ->to('#other')
                    ->content('This will be sent to #other');
    }

You may also use an image as your logo instead of an emoji:

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->from('Laravel')
                    ->image('https://laravel.com/favicon.png')
                    ->content('This will display the Laravel logo next to the message');
    }

### Slack Attachments

You may also add "attachments" to Slack messages. Attachments provide richer formatting options than simple text messages. In this example, we will send an error notification about an exception that occurred in an application, including a link to view more details about the exception:

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        $url = url('/exceptions/'.$this->exception->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->error()
                    ->content('Whoops! Something went wrong.')
                    ->attachment(function ($attachment) use ($url) {
                        $attachment->title('Exception: File Not Found', $url)
                                   ->content('File [background.jpg] was not found.');
                    });
    }

The example above will generate a Slack message that looks like the following:

<img src="https://laravel.com/assets/img/basic-slack-attachment.png">

Attachments also allow you to specify an array of data that should be presented to the user. The given data will be presented in a table-style format for easy reading:

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        $url = url('/invoices/'.$this->invoice->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->success()
                    ->content('One of your invoices has been paid!')
                    ->attachment(function ($attachment) use ($url) {
                        $attachment->title('Invoice 1322', $url)
                                   ->fields([
                                        'Title' => 'Server Expenses',
                                        'Amount' => '$1,234',
                                        'Via' => 'American Express',
                                        'Was Overdue' => ':-1:',
                                    ]);
                    });
    }

The example above will create a Slack message that looks like the following:

<img src="https://laravel.com/assets/img/slack-fields-attachment.png">

#### Markdown Attachment Content

If some of your attachment fields contain Markdown, you may use the `markdown` method to instruct Slack to parse and display the given attachment fields as Markdown formatted text. The values accepted by this method are: `pretext`, `text`, and / or `fields`. For more information about Slack attachment formatting, check out the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting#message_formatting):

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return SlackMessage
     */
    public function toSlack($notifiable)
    {
        $url = url('/exceptions/'.$this->exception->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->error()
                    ->content('Whoops! Something went wrong.')
                    ->attachment(function ($attachment) use ($url) {
                        $attachment->title('Exception: File Not Found', $url)
                                   ->content('File [background.jpg] was *not found*.')
                                   ->markdown(['text']);
                    });
    }

### Routing Slack Notifications

To route Slack notifications to the proper location, define a `routeNotificationForSlack` method on your notifiable entity. This should return the webhook URL to which the notification should be delivered. Webhook URLs may be generated by adding an "Incoming Webhook" service to your Slack team:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the Slack channel.
         *
         * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Notification  $notification
         * @return string
         */
        public function routeNotificationForSlack($notification)
        {
            return 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...';
        }
    }
